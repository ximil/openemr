<h3>README Claim History Project</h3>
<p>
This file contains notes and hints for developing and using the files and scripts in this "EDI Claim History" project.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the project is to gain ready access to edi claim information,
quickly identify submits, rejects, denials, payments, etc. and have the information
in a "big picture" format as well as the information needed to spot problems.
It is a "work-in-progress," unfinished, and will hopefully be improved upon. 
This phase is oriented to correctly parsing the x12 files, doing basic useful
things with the data, and having acceptable html output.  The next phase is improved 
integration with OpenEMR database information.
</p>
<p>
Nearly all the information that is important to this project is initially found in
the user's personal directories where the downloaded edi files are stored.  These are 
response files from payers or clearinghouses, such as claim status or ERA files.
There is at present no interaction with the OpenEMR database.  Therefore, while I find this project 
helpful, its usefulness to others depends on the kind of edi files they have.  That said, 
these scripts should be able to parse 837, 835, 277, and 999 x12 files from any source.
</p>
<p>
I use Availity, LLC as the clearinghouse for nearly all edi transfers so these scripts are
definitely oriented to Availity practices.  In particular, you may want to look at your 
Availity EDI Preferences setup so you are getting the types of files these scripts can read.
</p>
<p>
You should select "Include TA1" in the Availity preferences for .997 and .999 files 
in order for the scripts to be able to match these response files with the corresponding 
claims batch file you submitted.  Also, Availity provides x12 277CA files, the .277 type
for unsolicited claim responses, i.e. Availity checks the claims and the payers also
check the claims and return the results in a .277 file.  Importantly, file name practices
of your clearinghouse or payer must be taken into account because uploaded files are
categorized by file name patterns.  The patterns are found in <em>csv_record_include.php</em> 
in the function <em>csv_parameters()</em>.
</p>
<p>
One Availity setting that may be important is the grouping of ERA responses.  Mine are grouped by 
checks from a particular payer, so my ERA files will have responses from only one payer, 
with perhaps more than one "transaction" in each file.  Also, the &quot;multipayer&quot; options
help to reduce the number of Availity files one has to download.
</p>

<h3>OpenEMR Integration</h3>

<p>
    Access control is entirely under the OpenEMR scheme and will likely require the
    access permissions of &quot;accounting.&quot;
</p>
<p>
    Since the information in the EDI files is likely protected, Do not use these scripts on a public server!
</p>

<h3>File Locations:</h3>

<p>
The installed directory tree would be:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>/openemr/interface/billing </li>
	<li>/openemr/library/edihistory</li>
	<li>/openemr/library/css</li>
</ul>

<p>
Installed files:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>/openemr/Documentation
        <ul>
            <li>Readme_edihistory.html</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>/openemr/interface/billing </li>
		<ul>
			<li>edih_view.php</li>
			<li>edi_history_main.php</li>
			
		</ul>
	<li>/openemr/library/edihistory </li>
		<ul>
			<li>csv_record_include.php</li>
			<li>ibr_ack_read.php </li>
			<li>ibr_batch_read.php</li>
			<li>ibr_code_arrays.php </li>
			<li>ibr_997_read.php</li>
			<li>ibr_277_read.php</li>
			<li>ibr_ebr_read.php</li>
			<li>ibr_era_read.php</li>
			<li>ibr_status_code_arrays.php </li>
			<li>ibr_uploads.php</li>
            <li>ibr_271_read.php (not used as of this time)</li>
            <li>ibr_archive.php (not used as of this time)</li>
			<li>edi_history_log.txt (created by scripts)</li>         
        </ul>
	<li>/openemr/library/css</li>
		<ul>
            <li>csv_edihistory.css</li>
		</ul>
    <p>
       In addition, the project uses javascript libraries and related css already
       included in OpenEMR:
    </p>
	<li>/openemr/library/js <em>or</em> css</li>
		<ul>
            <li>jquery-1.7.1.min.js</li>
			<li>jquery-ui-1.8.18.custom.min.js</li>
			<li>jquery.dataTables.min.js</li>
			<li>jquery-ui-1.8.18.custom.css</li>
			<li>jquery.dataTables.css</li>
			
		</ul>
		
</ul>   

<p>
The scripts create a temporary uploads directory: /tmp/edihist
</p>
<p>
The <em>csv_setup()</em> function creates a file storage directory tree: </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; openemr/sites/default/edi/history </br>
with subdirectories: ack  csv  dpr ebr  era  f277  f997  ibr  text
</p>
<p>
and these csv files under: /var/www/htdocs/edihistory/edihist/sites/default/edi/history/csv</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; claims_277.csv  claims_ebr.csv  claims_ibr.csv  files_277.csv  files_ebr.csv	files_ibr.csv</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; claims_997.csv  claims_era.csv  claims_dpr.csv  files_997.csv  files_era.csv</br>
</p>
<p>
The path to these files set by <em>csv_edih_basedir()</em> based upon the OpenEMR directory paths.
</p>
<p>
Note:  I suggest the following edit to the OpenEMR <em>billing_process.php</em> script:
<pre><code>
  In the file openemr/interface/billing/billing_process.php
  in "function append_claim(&amp;$segs)"  at line 82  (after the "if (elems[0] == 'ST') { }" block)

    // add this mod 
    if ($elems[0] == 'BHT') {
       // this edit gives each claim a unique BHT id number, which allows the batch and claim to be identified
       //  in x12 277 files : isa-control-num and st-num are concatenated
       //  
       $bat_content .= str_replace("*0123*", sprintf("*%s%04d*", $bat_icn, $bat_stcount), $seg) . "~"; 
       continue;
    }
</code></pre>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
Once installed correctly, you begin usage by uploading your edi response files.
</p>
<p>
The &quot;edih_view.php&quot; features a tab format and the "New Files" tab is where we begin.
You can upload a zip archive or select one or more files.  The batch files are saved in the 
<em>/openemr/sites/edi</em> directory by OpenEMR when they are created, so you should not need to upload 
batch files.  Note the web server configuration will likely have a maximum for the number of 
files and the size of the upload.
</p>
<p>
On the first usage the setup function will be activated and the log file will be created.  
It will write the directory paths and create the csv files.  If this fails, the script will 
terminate and nothing more will happen.  The CSV Tables tab is useful after the edih_view.php 
file is reloaded in your browser, since it checks the csv table files and adds them to the list
of available tables if they have the minimum size.
</p>
<p>
Each file is checked when uploaded and files that do not meet the criteria will not be accepted. &nbsp; : ( &nbsp; 
If an uploaded file is already present, it will be discarded.  So, you can upload duplicates without 
worrying about whether it is already there.  Once a file is uploaded and stored, it is not overwritten 
or modified in any way, though the files are read to extract information or the contents are formatted for viewing.  
</p>
<p>
When you are done uploading files, click the "Process New" button and the scripts will read the new
files and populate the csv tables.  You can see HTML output which is a summary of the information.
Once the processing is done, you can look at csv tables for further information.
</p>
<p>
You upload and process your new edi files and, hopefully, the scripts will help you solve problems
and have a better grasp of your billing and collection process.  Note however, no accounting functions
are included in the scripts, so whatever accounting process you use remain necessary.
</p>
<p>
Other features are available in different tabs and should be self-explanatory.
For example, if a claim is rejected, use the View Batch Claim text to see what was 
sent for the actual claim.  Look at the csv tables to see a list of files or claims information.
View an ERA file to see payment details, etc. 
</p>
<p> 
There is the thought that there may eventually be so many response files that older 
ones are no longer wanted.  There is a draft script for archiving files and table contents into a 
zip file, but it is not well tested and there is no button to run it.
</p>
<p>
Although there is a script for reading x12 271 files (eligibility), it is only a draft and does not
do anything.  Since OpenEMR does not have the present ability to submit eligibility requests, I 
have no 271 response files to decipher so as to finish the script. 
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, the tedium of dealing with EDI responses will be significantly reduced and you will know, 
with relative ease, which claims are accepted, rejected, or paid.
