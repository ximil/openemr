Steps to install the RxNorm database:
1) Copy the zipped RxNorm database file into this directory (this file can be downloaded from
   http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/rxnormfiles.html; note you'll need to
   get an account and that only the Full Monthly Releases currently work)
2) In OpenEMR, go to Administration->Other->RxNorm in order to then install/upgrade
   the RxNorm database.
