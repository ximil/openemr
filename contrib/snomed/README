Steps to install the SNOMED database:
1) Copy the zipped SNOMED database file into this directory (this file can be downloaded from
   http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html; note you'll need to
   get an account and that only the biannual International Release currently works)
2) In OpenEMR, go to Administration->Other->SNOMED in order to then install/upgrade
   the SNOMED database.
