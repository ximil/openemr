This function uses htmlspecialchars() to escape a PHP string for use as
(part of) an HTML / XML text node (in DOM terms).

It only escapes a few special chars: the ampersand (&) and both the left-
pointing angle bracket (<) and the right-pointing angle bracket (>), since
these are the only characters that are special in a text node.  Minimal quoting
is preferred because it produces smaller and more easily human-readable output.

Some characters simply cannot appear in valid XML documents, even
as entities but, this function does not attempt to handle them.

NOTE: Attribute values are NOT text nodes, and require additional escaping.

/*
This function uses htmlspecialchars() to escape a PHP string for use as
part of an HTML / XML attribute value.  It does not surround the string in
single- or double-quote characters as is required for XML.

This does the maximal quoting handled by htmlspecialchars()

Some characters simply cannot appear in valid XML documents, even
as entities but, this function does not attempt to handle them.

NOTE: This can be used as a "generic" HTML escape since it does maximal
quoting.  However, some HTML and XML contexts (CDATA) don't provide escape
mechanisms.  Also, further pre- or post-escaping might need to be done when
embdedded other languages (like JavaScript) inside HTML / XML documents.
